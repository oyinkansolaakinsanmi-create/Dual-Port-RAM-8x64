# Dual-Port RAM in Verilog (8-bit x 64)

A synthesizable **dual-port RAM** module written in **Verilog HDL**, supporting independent read and write access on two ports (A and B).  
Simulated and verified using **Xilinx Vivado**.

---

## Features

- 64 x 8-bit memory array  
- Independent **read/write** for both ports  
- **Synchronous** operation (posedge clock)  
- **Write-through** behavior for same-cycle visibility  
- Verified with **Vivado behavioral simulation**
